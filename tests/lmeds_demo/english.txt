------------------------------

====================
audio_list_instructions
====================

On the next page you'll listen to a list of audio files separated by a brief pause.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_alternatives
====================

Although LMEDS was originally developed for collecting RPT annotations such as in the previous pages, there are other ways that one can use LMEDS to collect prosody annotations, as shown with the next two pages.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_constrained_instructions
====================

On the next page you'll perform a similar annotation task as before.  This time however, you will listen to the audio exactly twice before moving on.  Also, you will not be able to see the boundary markings you make during the first half of the task.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_mechanics_instructions
====================

<p style="text-align:center;font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
Experimental Procedure
</p>

You will be annotating excerpts of recorded conversations.  Each page contains the transcript for the excerpt and may also contain the audio recording.  For each excerpt, you will complete two tasks.  First you will break the text into smaller sequences of words.  Second, you will mark certain words.<br /><br />

In the first task, based on some criteria (see next page) you will select a word and a vertical bar will be appear after that word:<br /><br />
word word <b>word</b> | word word ...<br /><br /> 

If you change your mind after selecting a word, just select it again and the bar will disappear. In each utterance, you will be able to select as many words that match the necessary criteria. When you have finished, click 'submit'. This will transition you to the next task. <br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b> you will again select words (based on different criteria—see next page), however, this time, once you select a word its color will change to red:<br /><br />
word word <font color="red">word</font> word ...<br /><br />

If you change your mind, just select the word again and it will revert back to black.   During this phase, you will see where you marked the boundaries from the earlier task. When you are finished click <b>submit</b> to move on to the next excerpt.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_nonspecific_instructions
====================

As instructed previously, for each audio file, you will conduct two tasks. <br /><br />

In normal speech, speakers group words in a way that helps listeners interpret the utterance. <br /><br />

In the <b>first task</b>, break the text into chunks that reflect this grouping. <br /><br />

In normal speech, speakers pronounce some word or words in a sentence with more prominence than others. The prominent words are in a sense highlighted for the listener, and stand out from other non-prominent words.  <br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b>, mark words that you hear as prominent in this way. <br /><br />

There are <b>sixteen audio excerpts</b>.  Please use the second playback to review your work.  You will <b>not</b> be able to listen to the audio more than twice.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_randomized_instructions
====================

On the next few pages are randomized boundary and prominence pages.
<br /><br />
Mark the boundaries you hear based on pauses in the speech (there aren't
really any pauses in these short recordings though) and mark the prominences
based on the words you think stand out.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_with_limits
====================

The next few pages contain more prominence and boundary pages.  However,
on these pages, you'll be limited in the number of items you can select.
Specific instructions will be given for each page.

====================
fill_in_the_blank_instructions
====================

On the next page, please select the word that appears in the audio given.
<br /><br />
In LMEDS, it is possible to set a timer.  If the timer expires, the item is
automatically marked as incomplete and LMEDS progresses to the next page.
<b>The next page has a 10 second timer</b>.

====================
first_page
====================

Welcome to a demonstration of LMEDS functionality.  The stimuli items that will
be presented were simplified for this experiment but the instructions are all 
appropriate for the tasks.  <br /><br />

Before each task, you'll be presented with some explanatory text.  The next few slides
contain information we give to subjects participating from remote places.  Then there
is a consent form, and a demographics survey.<br /><br />

This demo should only take about 5 minutes to complete.

====================
keyboard_shortcuts
====================

On the next page there is a boundary and prominence page followed by 
a media choice page, as you have seen before.  However,
these pages have been configured to allow interaction via a keyboard.
Specific instructions will be given for each page.

====================
multingual_support
====================

Before continuing, note that LMEDS is multilingual. (translations provided by google translate).<br /><br />
続行する前に、LMEDS推定は、多言語であることに注意<br /><br />
Avant de continuer, notez que LMEDS est multilingue<br /><br />
जारी रखने से पहले, LMEDS बहुभाषी है कि ध्यान दें<br /><br />

====================
post_survey_instructions
====================

The next page features an actual post-experiment survey used in past studies conducted
over LMEDS.

====================
presurvey_instructions
====================

On the next page you'll fill out a demographics page.  These questions are derived
from actual demographics surveys conducted over LMEDS.<br /><br />

Note that you may skip as many items as you want.

====================
randomized_demo_introduction
====================

This is a short LMEDS sample experiment meant to demonstrate the randomization feature.
<br /><br />
Please read the user manual for more information about how to randomize the presentation
order of stimuli to users.

====================
remote_experiment_notice
====================

Before you begin the following experiment, please take note of the following points.
<br /><br />

<b>1)</b> Please <b>read all instructions</b> that appear throughout this experiment carefully.  Do not skip or skim instructions.<br /><br />

<b>2)</b> Please <b>wear headphones or earbuds</b> when listening to audio files.
<br /><br />

<b>3)</b> <b>You should be in a quiet room</b>, free from distraction for the duration of the experiment.  If there is significant background noise, such as in a cafe or other public area, you may have trouble listening to audio files and concentrating on the experiment.
<br /><br />

<b>4)</b> Please <b>silence or turn off your cell-phone</b> and other noise-making electronics.
<br /><br />

<b>5)</b> Please <b>close all other browser windows or tabs</b>--particularly those that issue auditory or visual alerts or status updates such as email providers or social networking websites.
<br /><br />

<b>6)</b> Unless instructed otherwise, please <b>do not perform other tasks</b> or otherwise stray from the current task while you are doing the experiment.
<br /><br />

<br />

By clicking 'submit' you acknowledge that you will follow these to the best of your ability.

====================
same_different_instructions
====================

On the next page, you will hear two audio files.  Please press the appropriate button
to indicate whether they are the same or different.

====================
same_different_randomized_instructions
====================

On the next few pages are a few same-different questions.  The order of the test items is randomized.

====================
sliders_in_surveys
====================

Sliders can also be used in surveys.

====================
speed_warning
====================

Your browser must be up-to-date and your internet speed must be fast to complete
this task, which involves listening to large audio files.<br /><br />

If you are on an old computer or have a slow internet connection, please release this
HIT.

====================
video_ok
====================

LMEDS can also play use video.  Any pages shown with audio files can have the audio replaced with video, as demonstrated next.

====================
whats_new_in_2.3
====================

LMEDS 2.3 has several new features.  Showcased here are the new kinds of pages that can be crafted in LMEDS 2.3.
These pages are included in the full demo, but for those just wanting to see the new stuff, this demo is for you.<br /><br />

New Features<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>Video now supported with the same controls and functionality as audio</li>
<li>Sliding scales are now a supported widget
<li>New syllable-marking page (branch of prominence-marking pages)
</ul>
