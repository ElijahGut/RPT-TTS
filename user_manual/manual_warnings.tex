\subsection{Creating and editing text files}

\paragraph{}

The input and outputs to LMEDS shouldn't be edited in a word processor.  A plain text editor should be used.  The text editors that come with most operating systems (notepad on Windows or Text Edit on mac) should be suitable however, you may want a more developed plain text editor.  I have personal experience with NotePad++, Gedit, and TextWrangler, which are all freely available tools.  If you search online, you can find reviews for editors that might suit you better.

\subsection{No spaces in names}

\paragraph{}

Please do not include spaces in folder or file names.  If you have a file composed of multiple words, either do not use spaces or use underscores.  E.g. for a folder that you want to call ``lmeds demo'', reasonable names include ``lmeds\_demo'' or ``lmedsDemo'' or ``lmedsdemo''.

\subsection{Errors in LMEDS}

\paragraph{}

LMEDS was written in python.  If something goes wrong (an unexpected or anticipated error) python will print out a formatted error report called a \textbf{stack trace}.  Unintuitively, the direct cause of the error is printed at the \textbf{bottom} of this report.  

\paragraph{}
While the stack trace can be difficult to understand for non-programmers, usually the direct cause is printed as reasonably understandable English.  For example the last line in the stack trace might be \textit{ERROR: Folder, ../tests/lmeds\_demo, does not exist} or it might be \textit{Text key axb\_instructions not in dictionary file english.txt.  Please add text key to dictionary and try again.'}

\paragraph{}
Errors are common when designing a new experiment (although the included script /lmeds/user\_scripts/sequence\_check.py can be used to automatically find common errors like missing resource files or incorrectly specified page definitions).  If an error occurs, don't panic.  Consult the error log as specified above.  If you are unsure about the error, please send it to me.
