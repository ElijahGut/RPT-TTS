A web platform for collecting text annotation and experiment data online.

LMEDS was originally developed for conducting Rapid Prosody Transcription annotations
over the internet.  Since then it has been extended for doing a number of
different types of perceptual experiments (memory tasks, AXB-type tasks, etc.).
