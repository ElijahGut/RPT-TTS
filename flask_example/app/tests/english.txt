<b>Investigators:</b>  Jennifer Cole (Dept. of Linguistics), José I. Hualde (Dept. of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese/Dept. of Linguistics) <br /><br />

<b>Purpose of this research:</b> This research will shed light on how speakers use prosody (intonation and rhythm) in speech to convey meaning, and how listeners perceive the prosodic features of spoken language. This work contributes to knowledge about how languages vary, and to knowledge about how adults process their native spoken language.  <br /><br />

<b>What you will be expected to do:</b>  If you agree to participate, you will be asked to listen to speech samples in your native language for which you will also be presented a transcription with punctuation removed, and perform one of the following tasks: (a) mark up a transcript of the speech sample to identify words that you perceive as prominent or to identify places in the utterance where you perceive a break; (b) select the most appropriate discourse context for the utterance you hear from among several that will be provided in text format (for instance, you may be asked to judge whether a recording of a speaker saying "John brought the pizza" sounds more like a reply to the question Who brought the pizza?  or to What did John bring?, based on the intonation of the recorded utterance.) <br /><br />

<b>Your compensation:</b> For your participation in this study you will be offered $9 per experimental session on completion of the session, or the equivalent amount in Euros. Each session lasts less than one hour. You may participate in up to five sessions. If you decide to withdraw before a session ends, you will receive no compensation for that session.  <br /><br />

<b>Your right to confidentiality:</b>  The data obtained in this research will be treated as confidential. Your name will be replaced with a code and no information will be released that may reveal your identity. All the data will be stored in a secure location (password-protected computers) and only the researchers will have access to them. <br /><br />

<b>Your right to withdraw at any time:</b> Your participation in this research is strictly voluntary. You may withdraw from it or discontinue participating at any time and you may also request to have your data destroyed without any negative consequences for you. <br /><br />

<b>Benefits:</b> The results of this investigation are intended to contribute to our understanding of the use of intonation in human communication. There are no direct benefits for you. <br /><br />

<b>Possible risks:</b>  To our knowledge there are no risks or discomforts involved in this research beyond those encountered in other everyday activities. <br /><br />

<b>Dissemination:</b> This research may be presented in academic lectures, at workshops or conferences, and may be published in conference proceedings, academic journal articles and book chapters. <br /><br />

<b>Your right to ask questions at any time:</b>  You may ask questions about this research at any time. You may contact the investigators  by email at jscole@illinois.edu and jihualde@illinois.edu or by phone at 1-217-333-3390.  <br /><br />

If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this study or any concerns or complaints, please contact the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board at 217-333-2670 (collect calls will be accepted if you identify yourself as a research participant) or via email at irb@illinois.edu <br /><br />

<b>Giving consent to participate:</b> By digitally signing this consent form, you certify that you are 18 years of age or older, that you have read the above and understand it, that you have been given satisfactory answers to any questions about the research, and that you have been advised that you are free to withdraw your consent and to discontinue participation in the research at any time, without prejudice. <br /><br />

Experimental Procedure
</p>

You will be annotating excerpts of recorded conversations.  Each page contains the transcript for the excerpt and may also contain the audio recording.  For each excerpt, you will complete two tasks.  First you will break the text into smaller sequences of words.  Second, you will mark certain words.<br /><br />

In the first task, based on some criteria (see next page) you will select a word and a vertical bar will be appear after that word:<br /><br />
word word <b>word</b> | word word ...<br /><br /> 

If you change your mind after selecting a word, just select it again and the bar will disappear. In each utterance, you will be able to select as many words that match the necessary criteria. When you have finished, click 'submit'. This will transition you to the next task. <br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b> you will again select words (based on different criteria—see next page), however, this time, once you select a word its color will change to red:<br /><br />
word word <font color="red">word</font> word ...<br /><br />

If you change your mind, just select the word again and it will revert back to black.   During this phase, you will see where you marked the boundaries from the earlier task. When you are finished click <b>submit</b> to move on to the next excerpt.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<i>The following instructions present the criteria for selecting words in this block.</i> 
</div>
<br />


As mentioned previously, for each audio file, you will conduct two tasks. <br /><br />

In the <b>first task</b>, you will mark the places where you hear a break, discontinuity or disconnection in the speech stream, strong or subtle. These break the fluid speech stream into different segments. <br /><br />


In the <b>second task</b> select the words that stand out in the speech stream by virtue of being louder, longer, more extreme in pitch, or more crisply articulated than other words in the same utterance.<br /><br />

There are <b>sixteen audio excerpts</b> in this block.  <b>Each audio file must be listened to twice in each task.</b>  Please use the second playback to review your work.  You will <b>not</b> be able to listen to the audio more than twice.

As instructed previously, for each audio file, you will conduct two tasks. <br /><br />


In the <b>first task</b>, select the words after which the audio file could be segmented with minimal disruption of the meaning of the speech.  <br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b> select the words that convey the main points of information as you think the speaker intended.<br /><br />


There are <b>sixteen audio excerpts</b> in this block.  Please use the second playback to review your work.  You will <b>not</b> be able to listen to the audio more than twice.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<i> The following instructions present the criteria for selecting words in this block.</i>

<br />

There are <b>sixteen text excerpts</b> in this block. <br /><br />

These excerpts are from <b>casual speech</b>.  They include sentence fragments, repairs and
restarts.  <b>You are to imagine that this is your speech.</b> <br /><br />

As instructed previously, for each excerpt, you will conduct two tasks. <br /><br />

In the <b>first task</b>, select the words where you imagine that
you would insert a break in the utterance to chunk the speech.<br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b> select the words that you would highlight for the listener.<br /><br />

For these two tasks, after each of them, review your selections carefully before continuing.
