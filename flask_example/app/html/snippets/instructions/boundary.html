<u><b>Part II: Boundary</b></u> <br /><br />

<div id="longText">

You will be listening to excerpts of speech of recorded conversations.  
You will be identifying spaces between words where the speaker has paused,
however briefly.<br /><br />

Each page will contain an audio file and the transcript for the audio file,
where underneath the space between each word there is a checkbox.  
For each of these utterances, mark the space if you feel the speaker
made a pause there.<br /><br />

In each utterance, you will be able to select as many as you feel apply.  Listen to the
audio closely, as it can only be played twice.<br /><br />

There are <b>two items</b> in this section.
