<u><b>Part I: Prominence</b></u> <br /><br />

<div id="longText">

You will be listening to excerpts of speech of recorded conversations.  
You will be identifying words that are important for the listener to 
understand or that present new information.<br /><br />

Each page will contain an audio file and the transcript for the audio file,
where each word has a checkbox underneath it.  For each of these utterances,
mark each word that you feel is important or presents new information based on
the way that the speaker said the word.<br /><br />

In each utterance, you will be able to select as many as you feel apply.  Listen to the
audio closely, as it can only be played twice.<br /><br />

There are <b>two items</b> in this section.
